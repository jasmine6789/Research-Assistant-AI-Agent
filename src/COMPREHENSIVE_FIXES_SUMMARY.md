# 🔧 COMPREHENSIVE FIXES SUMMARY: Dynamic Results Generation & LaTeX Enhancement

## 📋 Issues Identified & Resolved

### ❌ Original Problems
1. **Missing Table References**: LaTeX showing "Table ??" instead of proper numbers
2. **Zero Values Everywhere**: "0 machine learning algorithms", "0.000 accuracy"
3. **No Actual Model Performance**: Generic placeholder text instead of real findings
4. **IEEE Standards Violation**: Papers not meeting conference publication standards

### ✅ Root Causes Fixed
1. **Code Execution Failure**: Results extraction failing when exec_result is None
2. **Dataset Analysis Missing**: Incomplete dataset_analysis causing "0 samples/features"
3. **LaTeX Table References**: Reference system not properly linking labels to numbers
4. **Inadequate Fallback System**: Safety checks not comprehensive enough
